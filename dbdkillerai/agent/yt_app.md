* Your YouTube channel or whatever primary platform you use.

  - Thinking of a second channel for more life things and a third channel for gaming videos from streams/friends, but thats not my priority right now until the main channel is re-established.

* What are your long term goals for this content?
  - The channel's content shift is towards making AI Agents that play games for me whilst documenting that whole process and sharing insights. The first game is with Dead By Daylight and making an individual agent for each killer. After completing the base code for any killer, a long term goal is to make new *killer modules* that I can swap out to play a different killer since they only differ by a small ability, resulting in content delivery that doesn't require huge amounts of time between breaks.
  - **The code is not malicious! It does not inject anything into the game!**

  - Once I feel as though I exhaust the game, I'd like to pivot to a different First Person game. The good part is that if i structure my code properly now, I have a solid base to carry over to many different games with ease and less time in between videos. That is a second long-term goal I aim to achieve, using Dead By Daylight as that initial catalyst. 

  - Of course, the biggest long term goal is definitely to be monetized and make it full time, but I'm ok with having this be more of a side-gig and enjoy the hobby more as to not force it as work by the end. 

* How much you currently work on your content.
  - Almost everyday with the exception of spending time with family and friends. Realistically, maybe 4-5 days a week of at least an hour or two of work after work.

* How frequently do you upload/post new content.
  - I have not posted consistently in almost a decade. I've had a few videos in recent years, but the focus will be to post videos relating to the Agents once I have finished out the code. I'd like to aim for a video every 1-2 months. Very code dependent.

  - I'm actually looking to finish the base code and/or upload a video showing off the agent and discussing the code by June because by that month, I need to pause on content and focus on interview prepping for AI roles to change companies. These types of roles take awhile to study for, so I need that as priority since that is my main source of income. Once done and I land a job, I will go right back to content.

* Do you have a creative system that helps with content production? Tell us about it.
  - I don't think I do. I like watching other similar creators to try and think of a style for a future. Something between Micheal Reeves destructively showing off his code, the excited but tired nature of Basically Homeless, or being calm and straightforward like MKBHD. So, some B-roll clips are me being excited are present in a video folder for the future.

* How do you currently keep yourself on task when youâ€™re feeling down about content creation?
  - I remind myself that this was a dream when I was younger and **if I don't do it now, I never will.** I didn't utilize the initial intertia of uploading TF2 videos almsot a decade ago when I was gaining significant views(over 50K a video). I didn't have the confidence to keep growing and genuinely thought it to be cringe to only make gaming videos. Now I'm over this and regret it entirely, I'm scared that this dream of mine will never be realized to any fruition, and if this becomes a side-gig, I won't have to worry about pursuing other means of income that I'm not as interested in as I am this.To be clear, money is not the sole driving force because I've always enjoyed the content creation. 

  - If I get overwhelmed and want to quit, it's most likely because I don't understand my next step, so I force myself to **write a todo list with the smallest, tangible bullet points I can achieve to get back the intertia to keep going**.
     

* What do you expect out of a group like this?
  - Accountability. I've always said I'll do a thing and then never follow through on it. Laziness, forgetfullness, I'm not even sure. But I recognize that I need a push beyond myself to help guide me forward and be more focused on this.
  - ALl of my friends that I know outside of discord don't care for content creation in anyway and I want to surround myself with people who are focused on the dream like this to keep eachother motivated. I believe that you must surround yourself with like-minded people of your interests in order to grow.
