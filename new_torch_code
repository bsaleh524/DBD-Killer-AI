Hi johnny,
Thank you for requesting the source code for "Real Time Deep SORT with Torchvision Detectors".

I am also including a link for all my source code, datasets, pre-trained models, and so on, below.

Why did I start this blog?

I am an entrepreneur with a love for Computer Vision and Machine Learning with 15 years of experience (and a Ph.D.) in the field.

I love teaching through my blog and courses! I believe one should give back to the community more than one takes. That's how civilization moves forward.

As an entrepreneur who has built products that have reached more than 100M people, I learned how academic papers do not always translate to real world solutions.

There is a huge gap between what is taught in schools and in books, and the technical smarts needed to build a real world product.

In my blog and courses I share what I have learned from the real world so others can spend their time working on newer and bigger problems rather than struggling with the same problems I spent hours solving.

And then there is the sheer frustration of being a beginner -- you have ideas in your head. Good ideas. Even great ideas!

But you do not yet have the tools to translate those ideas to code.

You don't want to be spoon fed. You are ready to put in the effort required of a beginner, but you want a force-multiplier in your learning process that would give the biggest return on your time investment.

I hope to serve as a catalyst in this learning process.

It is my goal to publish material that helps readers grasp Computer Vision and Machine Learning concepts with the help of examples in Python and C++. I hope you find this blog useful, informative, and entertaining.

Regards,
LearnOpenCV Team

P.S. Here's the other code and examples I mentioned. - Happy Learning! ðŸ˜Š
