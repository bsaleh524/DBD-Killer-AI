* Are all of these questions basically steering us towards #video-creators?
* Do we want accountability? If Yes:
* -- How often should this happen? Once a week? Twice a week?
* -- Should there be a dedicated day for everyone to check-in?
* -- What does accountability *mean*? Is it a screenshot, a google drive of dumped work, a pinned comment, etc. BLUF: What should someone respond to when asked, "Hey, what have you done since we last checked in?"
* The purpose of the channel was originally an "editing room" where like-minded folks can share/live stream themselves present in the moment. Silent or with voice. Since then, the silence isn't exactly ideal and timezones differ between individuals, so the VC isn't used as often. Should the VC still exist for a different purpose or get rid of it altogether?

If there's a question that isn't here that should be answered, reply with a question and we should have it answered together.
