TODO:
* Data
    - change pallet labels to cover everything, not just the portion
    - Make more splits of data augmentations
* Training:
    - use yolo api, not CLI
    - Make the paths make more sense.
    - make a tree split of all stuff(data splits vs yolo models vs epochs vs...)
    - Figure out all important metrics to grab. Focus on those. Make it presentable using some kind of script.

* After decent enough model is made:
    - Pick best model, and figure out how to grab labels, boxes, and scores for deepsort tracking
    - (optional) test on a recorded video
    - How to stream this game from OBS(?) to the model
    - Figure out how to control the game with another computer


to understand:
- what is dfl_loss
- what is cls_loss
- what is box_loss

Model:
- Transfer learn 'survivor' as a 'person'? Or transfer learn 'person' as a 'survivor'?
- Make Notebook of results for Yolov8

Minimap Tasks
1. Create dataset with only hooks and generators -- done
2. Run trained model on video
    1. Write training code for yolov8
        1. Train model
        2. Load weights of model
        3. Evaluate model
            - Write all in code, then implement in notebook.
    2. Enable video to be used
    3. (Later): Live stream game to model (use OBS controller server?)
3. 
- Create 2d map from mouse detections

Agent Behavior:
- start defining agent behavior:
    - STATES (check generators, chase, go hook)
    - ACTIONS (Kick generator, hit survivor, break pallet, etc)
    - TRANSITIONS (pick up survivor, )
    - COST (Distance to generator not worth it, chase_time >threshold-> abandon, etc)


- exploration is done. Cleanup above, then look into training and result model part.
